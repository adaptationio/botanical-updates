# Botaniqal Booking Flow - Improvements Analysis

## Current Flow Pain Points

### 1. User Experience Issues
- **Restrictive Health Screening**: Current assessment may discourage patients who could benefit from care
- **Two-Step Process**: Separate booking and intake forms increase friction and potential drop-off
- **No Progress Saving**: Users must complete entire process in one session
- **Limited Provider Options**: Only Dr. Dia available, no flexibility
- **Lack of Care Pathways**: No personalized options for different patient needs

### 2. Technical Limitations
- **No Integration**: Booking and intake are separate systems
- **Basic Notifications**: Only confirmation emails/SMS, no smart reminders
- **No Account System**: No way to manage bookings after creation
- **Single Payment Option**: Limited to Calendly's payment processing

### 3. Accessibility Concerns
- **Limited Care Options**: Patients with complex needs have few alternatives
- **No Support Features**: Can't share with carers or save information
