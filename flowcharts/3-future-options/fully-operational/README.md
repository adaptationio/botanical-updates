# Fully Operational Flowcharts - Navigation Guide

## üîÑ System Complexity

The fully operational system is broken into multiple documents because:

- Multiple overlapping pathways created visual confusion
- Different audiences need different levels of detail
- Maintenance is easier with modular documentation

2. **Combined Calendars** - Shows only relevant practitioners per service
3. **Multi-Service Support** - Integrated care planning and booking
4. **Smart Triage** - Matches patients to optimal practitioner
5. **Flexible Pathways** - Phone booking for new, online for returning
