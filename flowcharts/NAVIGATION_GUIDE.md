## 🎯 Common Navigation Scenarios

### "I want to understand the current booking process"
→ Go to `1-current-system/booking/`

### "I want to see the ready-to-deploy triage system"
→ Go to `2-new-update/consultant/triage-flow.md`

### "I want to see our target implementation design"
→ Go to `3-target-implementation/`
- For phased approach: `coming-soon/`
- For full launch: `fully-operational/`

### "I want to compare current vs ready-to-deploy admin features"
→ Compare:
- `1-current-system/admin/` (current)
- `2-new-update/admin/` (ready to deploy)

### "I want to understand the full vision we're building"
→ Go to `3-target-implementation/fully-operational/`

### "I want to see the phased rollout approach"
→ Go to `3-target-implementation/coming-soon/`

## 📁 Folder Purpose Summary

| Folder | Purpose | Key Question | Status |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------|
| **1-current-system** | Document existing system | "What do we have now?" | Live |
| **2-new-update** | Ready-to-deploy upgrade | "What can we deploy immediately?" | Ready |
| **3-target-implementation** | Main implementation design | "What are we building toward?" | In Design |
| **_analysis** | Decision support | "How do they compare?" | Ongoing |

## 🔄 Typical User Journeys

### Developer Journey
1. Start at `1-current-system/tech/` to understand current architecture
2. Move to `2-new-update/tech/` to see immediate changes needed
3. Study `3-target-implementation/*/tech/` for full platform requirements
4. Check implementation variation differences

### Business Stakeholder Journey
1. Start at `_analysis/improvements-summary.md` to understand why changes
2. Review `2-new-update/booking/` to see immediate improvements
3. Explore `3-target-implementation/` variations for strategic planning
4. Compare `coming-soon/` vs `fully-operational/` for rollout decision

### New Team Member Journey
1. Start with this guide
2. Review `1-current-system/README.md` to understand today
3. Review `2-new-update/README.md` to understand immediate plans
4. Study `3-target-implementation/README.md` for full vision
5. Browse specific roles as needed

## 💡 Navigation Tips

- **Each major folder has a README** - Start there for context
- **Numbered folders show progression** - 1→2→3 represents evolution
- **Target implementation has variations** - Choose based on rollout strategy
- **Role-based organization** - Find flows by user type (admin, doctor, etc.)
- **Use comparisons** - Most value comes from comparing same files across versions

## 🎯 Key Understanding

- **Current → Ready → Target** represents the implementation journey
- **Target Implementation** is the main system being designed, not distant future
- **Variations** in target help decide rollout approach (phased vs full)
- All documentation reflects actual plans, not theoretical possibilities
