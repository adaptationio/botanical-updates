*These role-based flows represent the target implementation we are actively designing. They build upon the ready-to-deploy system in [2-new-update](../../2-new-update/) and detail the full multi-service platform we're building toward. The flows have been copied into both [coming-soon](../coming-soon/) and [fully-operational](../fully-operational/) variations for implementation planning.*
