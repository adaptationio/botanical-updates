# Fully Operational Flowcharts - Navigation Guide

## üìã Overview
The fully operational variation represents the complete vision with all 5 services active and 8 practitioners. Due to the complexity, the flows have been broken into focused, digestible documents.

   - Original comprehensive flowchart (245 lines)
   - Single diagram with all 100+ nodes
   - Complete flow in one view

   - System integration points
   - Technical requirements
   - Architecture overview

## üéØ Where to Start

### For Business Stakeholders
1. Start with **[patient-booking-overview.md](./booking/patient-booking-overview.md)**
2. Review service portfolio in **[patient-booking-flow.md](./booking/patient-booking-flow.md)**
3. Understand patient experience via journey documents

### For Technical Teams
1. Review **[technical-architecture.md](./tech/tech-architecture-flow.md)**
2. Study detailed flows for integration points
3. Check **[phone-booking-process.md](./consultant/phone-booking-process.md)** for payment integration

### For Operations Staff
1. Focus on **[service-triage-process.md](./consultant/service-triage-process.md)**
2. Understand **[phone-booking-process.md](./consultant/phone-booking-process.md)**

## üìä Quick Stats

- **Services**: 5 (Alt Med, GAPS, Weight Loss, Counseling, Equine)
- **Practitioners**: 8 (including consultant role)
- **Booking Paths**: 2 (New patient triage, Returning self-service)
- **Appointment Types**: 15+
- **Payment Options**: Multiple (CC, HSA/FSA, Payment plans)

## üîÑ System Complexity

The fully operational system is broken into multiple documents because:
- Single diagram had 180+ lines with 100+ nodes (see [original version](./booking/patient-booking-flow-original.md))
- Multiple overlapping pathways created visual confusion
- Different audiences need different levels of detail
- Maintenance is easier with modular documentation

## üí° Key Innovations

1. **Dynamic Intake Forms** - Consultant selects appropriate form during call
2. **Combined Calendars** - Shows only relevant practitioners per service
3. **Multi-Service Support** - Integrated care planning and booking
4. **Smart Triage** - Matches patients to optimal practitioner
5. **Flexible Pathways** - Phone booking for new, online for returning
