# Target Implementation - Main Design

This folder contains the **MAIN IMPLEMENTATION** we are actively designing and refining for the booking system expansion.

## Overview
These flowcharts represent our **TARGET SYSTEM** - the actual implementation we're building toward, with multiple service offerings and enhanced capabilities beyond the ready-to-deploy version.

### Implementation Status
- **1-current-system**: What exists today (single practitioner, basic flow)
- **2-new-update**: Ready to deploy (multi-practitioner with triage) 
- **3-target-implementation**: THIS - Our main implementation being designed (5 services, 8+ practitioners)

### Key Implementation Features
All variations maintain enhanced core processes:
- Free consultation with consultant-completed specialty intake forms
- Dynamic form selection based on patient's service interests
- Phone booking after assessment for new patients
- Direct follow-up booking for returning patients
- Multi-service support with integrated care pathways

## Implementation Variations

We are refining different approaches to rolling out this target system:

### ðŸš€ Coming Soon Variation
`coming-soon/` - Phased implementation approach
- Weight Loss Program launches first
- Other services (Counseling, Equine Therapy) captured via waitlist
- Lower risk, gradual market entry
- Allows testing and refinement before full launch

Organized by role:
- `admin/` - Admin workflows and dashboard
- `booking/` - Patient booking flows
- `consultant/` - Consultant triage processes
- `doctor/` - Doctor appointment flows
- `tech/` - Technical architecture

### ðŸŒŸ Fully Operational Variation  
`fully-operational/` - Complete implementation from day one
- All 5 services active simultaneously
- 8+ practitioners fully onboarded
- Maximum revenue potential
- Higher complexity and resource requirements

Organized by role:
- `admin/` - Admin workflows and dashboard
- `booking/` - Patient booking flows
- `consultant/` - Consultant triage processes
- `doctor/` - Doctor appointment flows
- `tech/` - Technical architecture

### ðŸ“ˆ Service Funnels
`service-funnels/` - Marketing and conversion flows for the target implementation
- Service-specific landing pages
- Conversion optimization strategies
- Email nurture sequences
- Waitlist management for phased approach

### ðŸŽ­ Role Flows (Archive)
`roles/` - Original role-based documentation
- Now distributed into coming-soon and fully-operational folders
- Kept for reference and comparison

## Implementation Services

### Target Service Portfolio
1. **Alternative Medicine** - Telehealth consultations
2. **GAPS Diet Coaching** - Specialized nutrition program
3. **Weight Loss Program** - Medical weight management
4. **Counseling Services** - Mental health support
5. **Equine Therapy** - Alternative therapeutic approach

### Practitioner Team (Target)
- 2 Doctors (Dr Dia, Dr. Shivani)
- 1 Nurse Practitioner
- 1 GAPS Coach (Ramona)
- 1 Consultant (triage role)
- 2 Counselors
- 1 Equine Therapy Specialist

## Implementation Decision Framework

These variations help determine:
1. **Rollout Strategy**: Phased vs full launch
2. **Resource Planning**: Staffing and system requirements
3. **Risk Management**: Testing with limited services first
4. **Market Approach**: Gradual expansion vs complete offering

## Key Differences from Ready-to-Deploy (2-new-update)

| Aspect | Ready-to-Deploy | Target Implementation |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|
| Services | 2 (Alt Med, GAPS) | 5 (+ Weight Loss, Counseling, Equine) |
| Practitioners | 5 | 8+ |
| Complexity | Moderate | High |
| Market Position | Foundation | Full Service Clinic |
| Technical Needs | Basic Integration | Advanced Multi-Service Platform |

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Variation Choice**: Decide between phased or full implementation
2. **Resource Planning**: Allocate budget and staff for chosen approach
3. **Technical Development**: Build enhanced platform capabilities
4. **Marketing Strategy**: Develop service-specific funnels
5. **Training Program**: Prepare team for multi-service operations
