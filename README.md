## Viewing the Flowcharts

All flowcharts are created using Mermaid markdown syntax. To view them:

1. **GitHub**: GitHub automatically renders Mermaid diagrams in markdown files
2. **VS Code**: Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
3. **Online**: Use [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live)
4. **Other Tools**: Most modern markdown viewers support Mermaid

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Deploy "New Update" features
   - User experience enhancements
   - Admin automation tools
   - Microservices migration

2. **Phase 2**: Incremental "Proposed" features
   - AI integration
   - Advanced analytics
   - Community features

3. **Phase 3**: Revolutionary features
   - AR/VR experiences
   - Blockchain integration
   - Quantum-ready systems

## Using These Flowcharts

These diagrams serve multiple purposes:
- **Development Planning**: Guide implementation priorities
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Visual representation of improvements
- **Architecture Documentation**: Technical reference
- **Progress Tracking**: Compare current vs planned state

## Next Steps

1. Review all flowcharts with stakeholders
2. Prioritize features for implementation
3. Create detailed technical specifications
4. Begin phased implementation
5. Track progress against these blueprints
