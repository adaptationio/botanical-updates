# Next Steps - Priority Work Items

## ðŸš¨ Priority 1: Critical Documentation (Short timeline)

### 1. Complete Security Documentation
**Why Critical**: Healthcare system handling patient data requires security documentation before launch.

Create these files in `docs/security/`:
- [ ] `DATA_ENCRYPTION.md` - How patient data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- [ ] `ACCESS_CONTROL.md` - Role-based access control matrix
- [ ] `AUTHENTICATION_FLOW.md` - How users authenticate (patients, practitioners, admin)
- [ ] `INCIDENT_RESPONSE.md` - What to do if there's a security breach

### 2. Database Schema Documentation
**Why Critical**: Developers need to know data structure for implementation.

Create `docs/technical/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` with:
- [ ] Patient table structure
- [ ] Booking table structure
- [ ] Practitioner table structure
- [ ] Form submission storage
- [ ] Audit trail tables

### 3. Integration Setup Guides
**Why Critical**: Third-party services are core to the booking system.

Create in `docs/integration/`:
- [ ] `CALENDLY_SETUP.md` - How to configure 5+ Calendly calendars
- [ ] `MEDIRECORDS_CONFIG.md` - MediRecords integration steps
- [ ] `STRIPE_INTEGRATION.md` - Payment processing setup
- [ ] `OFFICE365_WEBHOOKS.md` - Calendar sync configuration

## ðŸ“‹ Priority 2: Implementation Readiness (Short to medium timeline)

### 4. Create Development Setup Guide
Create `docs/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`:
- [ ] Local environment setup
- [ ] Required API keys and where to get them
- [ ] Docker configuration
- [ ] Testing environment setup

### 5. Error Handling Documentation
Create `docs/technical/ERROR_HANDLING.md`:
- [ ] Common error scenarios and solutions
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Logging standards
- [ ] Recovery procedures

### 6. Testing Documentation
Create `docs/testing/`:
- [ ] `TEST_SCENARIOS.md` - Critical user journeys to test
- [ ] `LOAD_TESTING.md` - Performance requirements
- [ ] `SECURITY_TESTING.md` - Security test cases

## ðŸŽ¯ Priority 3: Business Process Documentation (Medium timeline)

### 7. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)
Create `docs/operations/`:
- [ ] `DAILY_ADMIN_TASKS.md` - Step-by-step admin procedures
- [ ] `PRACTITIONER_ONBOARDING.md` - How to add new practitioners
- [ ] `PATIENT_SUPPORT.md` - Common issues and solutions
- [ ] `BOOKING_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Fixing booking problems

### 8. Training Materials
Create `docs/training/`:
- [ ] `CONSULTANT_TRAINING.md` - How to conduct triage
- [ ] `ADMIN_TRAINING.md` - System administration
- [ ] `PRACTITIONER_GUIDE.md` - Using the booking system

## ðŸ’¡ Priority 4: Nice-to-Have Enhancements (Extended timeline)

### 9. Monitoring and Analytics
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboard design
- [ ] Define KPIs to track
- [ ] Set up alerting thresholds
- [ ] Design reporting templates

### 10. Future Enhancements Documentation
- [ ] Document how to add new services
- [ ] Scalability considerations
- [ ] Performance optimization opportunities
- [ ] Automation possibilities

## ðŸ”„ Priority 5: Continuous Improvements

### 11. Feedback Loop Setup
- [ ] Create feedback collection process
- [ ] Define improvement workflow
- [ ] Set up regular review cycles

### 12. Documentation Maintenance
- [ ] Create documentation update process
- [ ] Version control strategy
- [ ] Change log maintenance

## Quick Wins (Do These First!)

1. **Create Basic API Documentation** (2 hours)
   - List all endpoints with examples
   - Show authentication flow
   - Provide sample requests/responses

2. **Write Deployment Checklist** (1 hour)
   - Pre-deployment verification steps
   - Go-live checklist
   - Rollback procedures

3. **Document Known Issues** (1 hour)
   - Current limitations
   - Workarounds
   - Planned fixes

## Decision Points Needed

Before proceeding, get clarity on:

1. **Compliance Requirements**
   - Is HIPAA compliance required?
   - What about GDPR for EU patients?
   - Local Australian healthcare regulations?

2. **Technical Stack Confirmation**
   - Confirm AWS as cloud provider
   - Database choice (PostgreSQL? MySQL?)
   - Hosting for frontend (Vercel? Netlify?)

3. **Service Expansion Timeline**
   - When will Weight Loss launch?
   - Counseling service requirements?
   - Equine therapy logistics?

4. **Integration Priorities**
   - Which integrations are must-have for launch?
   - What can be added post-launch?
   - Backup plans if integrations fail?

## Recommended Next Action

**Start with Priority 1, Item 2**: Create the database schema documentation. This will:
- Force decisions about data structure
- Reveal any missing requirements
- Enable parallel development work
- Be immediately useful for developers

## Success Metrics

Track progress by:
- [ ] Security documentation complete
- [ ] All integrations documented
- [ ] Development team can self-serve setup
- [ ] Admin team has clear procedures
- [ ] Testing plan in place
- [ ] Go-live checklist ready
